***Engineering Graphics***<br>
  <br>
Unit 1: Introduction to Engineering Drawing (04 Hrs.)<br>
Introduction, Use of various drawing instruments, Lettering, Layout of drawing sheet, Sizes of the<br>
drawing sheets, Different types of lines used in the drawing practice, Dimensioning–Linear, Angular,<br>
Aligned system, Unidirectional system, Parallel dimensioning, Chain dimensioning, Location dimension<br>
and Size dimension, Concept of RF.<br>
  <br>
Unit 2: Projections of Points and Lines (05 Hrs.)<br>
Projections of points in all possible position w.r.t. reference planes, Projections of lines when it is<br>
perpendicular to one of the reference planes, When line is inclined to one and parallel to other reference<br>
plane, Line inclined to both reference planes, Applications of projection of lines and concept of traces of<br>
lines.<br>
  <br>
Unit 3: Projections of Planes and Solids (05 Hrs.)<br>
Projections of planes when it is parallel to one of the reference planes, lying in reference plane, when it is<br>
perpendicular to one and inclined to other reference plane, when it is inclined to both reference planes,<br>
Projections on auxiliary planes. Projection of solid when axis is perpendicular to one of the reference<br>
planes, when axis is inclined to one and parallel to other reference plane, When axis is inclined to both the<br>
reference planes, Projection of cube, right regular prisms, Right regular pyramids, Right circular cylinder,<br>
Right circular cone, Tetrahedron, Frustum of solids.<br>
  <br>
Unit 4: Orthographic Projection (06 Hrs.)<br>
Multi view orthographic projections for parts/ patterns with isometric/ non-isometric surfaces and circular<br>
features and sectional views. Reading of orthographic projections.<br>
  <br>
Unit 5: Isometric Projection (06 Hrs.)<br>
Definition of isometric view, Projection, Isometric scale, Non-isometric lines, Circular features in context<br>
of isometric projection. Construction of isometric view/ projection from given orthographic views.<br>
  <br>
Unit 6: Introduction to Computer Aided Drawing (04 Hrs.)<br>
Computer screen, Layout of the software, standard tool bar/ menus and description of most commonly<br>
used tools bars, Navigational tools. Creation of 2D/3D environment. Commands and creation of co-<br>
ordinate points, lines, axes, polylines, square, rectangle, polygons, splines, circles, ellipse, text, move,<br>
copy, offset, mirror, rotate, trim, extend, break, chamfer, fillet, zoom, pan, curves, constraints viz.<br>
tangency, parallelism, inclination and perpendicularity. Dimensioning, line conventions, lettering. Line<br>
properties, 3D modelling of basic solids and their intersections.<br>
